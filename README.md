# Backpack
Backpack is a simple Inventory Management System designed for small businesses and individuals looking to be more organized.

This is a working directory. To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and in the command line, type:
py manage.py runserver
to initialize the development server. Not that this project requires the latest versions of Python, Django, and Pillow.
Django and Pillow are both available using PIP.
